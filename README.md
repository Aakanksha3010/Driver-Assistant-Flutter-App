## Driver Assistant Flutter App

Drowsiness detection is one of those normal issue should have been settled to forestall street mishaps. 
In ongoing time's auto weariness associated crashes have extremely extended. Driver's heedlessness may be the 
consequence of an absence of sharpness when driving because of driver sleepiness and interruption.
Hence, we come up with a solution which is a  flutter app that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a
real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.
